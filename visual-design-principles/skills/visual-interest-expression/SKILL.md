description: This skill should be used when the user is defining brand personality in design, choosing between illustration and photography, adding motion or animation, creating visual motifs, ensuring layout variety, customizing CSS framework defaults, or calibrating the level of creative expression for a given context. Covers Lavie & Tractinsky's expressive aesthetics, the expression spectrum (restrained to bold), brand personality translation, illustration systems, photography direction, and template independence.

# Competent but Forgettable Is Not the Goal — Calibrate Expression to Context

Lavie & Tractinsky (2004) distinguish classical aesthetics (clean, orderly) from expressive aesthetics (creative, original). Both dimensions independently predict user satisfaction. A design can be perfectly structured and still feel lifeless if it lacks any visual personality. The challenge is calibrating expression to context — too little feels generic, too much feels chaotic.

## The Expression Spectrum

Match the level of visual expression to the product context. Mismatched expression erodes trust.

| Context | Expression Level | Characteristics |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Government / Healthcare | Minimal | Neutral colors, system fonts, no illustration, maximum restraint |
| Enterprise SaaS (B2B) | Low-Moderate | Subtle brand color, clean icons, restrained illustration, professional photography |
| Consumer SaaS (B2C) | Moderate | Distinctive brand palette, custom illustrations, personality in microcopy, playful motion |
| Creative Agencies / Portfolio | High | Bold typography, strong color, expressive layout, animation as storytelling |
| Luxury / Fashion | High but Controlled | Rich imagery, refined typography, generous whitespace, minimal UI chrome |

## Brand Personality Translation

Map Aaker's brand personality dimensions (1997) to visual decisions.

| Dimension | Typography | Color | Imagery | Motion |
|-----------|-----------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Sincerity** | Rounded sans-serif, warm | Earth tones, warm neutrals | Friendly illustrations, real photography | Gentle, ease-in-out |
| **Excitement** | Bold display, tight tracking | Vibrant, high-saturation | Dynamic angles, bold graphics | Energetic, spring curves |
| **Competence** | Clean geometric sans | Blue-dominant, cool neutrals | Data visualizations, structured layouts | Precise, linear easing |
| **Sophistication** | Serif or thin sans, generous spacing | Black/white + one accent | High-end photography, minimal illustration | Subtle, slow reveals |
| **Ruggedness** | Slab serif, heavy weight | Dark, muted earth tones | Textured backgrounds, raw photography | Minimal, mechanical |

## Layout Variety for Landing Pages

Use 3-5 distinct section layout patterns. Repeating the same layout creates monotony; using too many creates chaos.

| Pattern | Structure | Best For |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Hero** | Full-width, large heading + CTA + hero image/illustration | Opening section, above the fold |
| **Text + Media** | 50/50 or 60/40 split, alternating sides | Feature explanations, benefit sections |
| **Card Grid** | 3-4 column grid of equal cards | Feature lists, pricing, testimonials |
| **Full-Width Break** | Edge-to-edge image, quote, or color block | Visual breathing room between dense sections |
| **Data/Social Proof** | Large numbers, logos, or stats in a row | Trust signals, metrics |

**Rhythm rule:** Alternate between dense sections (card grid, text+media) and open sections (full-width break, hero) to create visual cadence.

## Illustration System

- Prefer **custom illustrations** over stock. Stock illustrations shared across competitors destroy brand identity.
- Define a style guide: consistent color palette, line weight (2px), perspective (flat or isometric), and character style.
- Maintain an illustration library — reuse elements across pages for cohesion.
- Size illustrations deliberately: spot illustrations (64-128px) for inline use, hero illustrations (400-600px) for section anchors.

## Photography Direction

- Apply **consistent color grading** across all photos (warm, cool, desaturated, or brand-tinted).
- Define composition rules: subject placement, background style, crop ratios.
- Avoid generic stock: no handshake photos, no diverse-people-around-laptop, no woman-laughing-with-salad.
- When mixing photography with UI, maintain consistent treatment (rounded corners, shadow, overlay).

## Purposeful Motion

Animate only to communicate meaning. Motion without purpose is decoration that slows the experience.

| Rule | Guideline |
|------|-----------|
| **Animate only transform + opacity** | GPU-composited, avoids layout thrashing |
| **Duration** | 150-300ms for UI transitions; up to 500ms for page-level choreography |
| **Easing** | `ease-out` for entrances, `ease-in` for exits, `ease-in-out` for state changes |
| **Stagger** | 50-100ms delay between list items for sequential reveal |
| **Reduced motion** | Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` — disable non-essential animation |

## Template Detection Levels

Evaluate how far a design has departed from its framework default. Customer-facing products must reach Level 2 or higher.

| Level | Description | Indicator |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| 0 | Raw template | Default colors, default components, placeholder content |
| 1 | Themed template | Custom colors applied but layout/components unchanged |
| 2 | Customized | Custom layout, modified components, brand typography |
| 3 | Distinctive | Unique visual language, custom illustrations, motion system |
| 4 | Bespoke | Fully original design, no trace of framework origin |

## Visual Motifs

Establish 2-3 recurring visual elements that appear across pages: a distinctive shape (rounded rectangles, circles, angular cuts), a pattern (dot grids, subtle lines), or a color treatment (gradient, duotone). Apply them consistently in headers, dividers, backgrounds, and illustrations.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Unmodified template (Level 0-1) | Looks identical to thousands of other sites | Customize layout, typography, and components to Level 2+ |
| Animation on every element | Feels chaotic, slows perceived performance | Animate only on meaningful state changes |
| Inconsistent expression (playful here, corporate there) | Confusing brand signal | Define expression level once, apply uniformly |
| Stock everything (illustrations + photos + icons from different sources) | Visual incoherence, no brand identity | Commit to one illustration style, one photo treatment |
| Motion without `prefers-reduced-motion` | Accessibility violation, motion-sensitivity risk | Always provide reduced-motion fallback |

## Cross-Media Notes

- **Presentations:** Define 2-3 slide master layouts and use them consistently. Apply brand colors, typography, and motifs to every slide. A consistent deck builds credibility; a mismatched one destroys it.
- **CVs/Resumes:** Subtle personality touches — a tasteful accent color, a distinctive but readable font pairing, or a minimal geometric element — differentiate without sacrificing professionalism.
- **Brand Systems:** Visual expression must be consistent across all touchpoints — website, emails, presentations, social media. Define a brand kit and enforce it.

## Review Checklist

When reviewing or building for visual expression:

- [ ] Expression level is calibrated to context (enterprise = restrained, consumer = moderate+)
- [ ] Brand personality dimensions are reflected in typography, color, imagery, and motion
- [ ] Landing page uses 3-5 distinct section layout patterns with alternating density
- [ ] Illustrations follow a consistent style guide (color, line weight, perspective)
- [ ] Photography has consistent color grading and composition rules
- [ ] Motion is purposeful: only animating `transform` and `opacity` at 150-300ms
- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` disables all non-essential animation
- [ ] Stagger delays are 50-100ms between sequential items
- [ ] Template detection level is 2+ for customer-facing pages
- [ ] 2-3 visual motifs are established and consistently applied
- [ ] No unmodified framework defaults visible in customer-facing UI
- [ ] Visual style is consistent across all pages — no section looks like it belongs to a different site
