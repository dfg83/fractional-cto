name: using-cloud-foundation-principles
description: This skill should be used when the user asks "which cloud foundation skill should I use", "show me all cloud principles", "help me pick an infrastructure pattern", or at the start of any cloud infrastructure, Terraform, or IaC conversation. Provides the index of all twelve principle skills and ensures the right ones are invoked before any cloud infrastructure work begins.
version: 1.0.0

<IMPORTANT>
When working on any cloud infrastructure pattern — account structure, naming conventions, Terraform organization, networking, security, credentials, secrets, deployment pipelines, or operational processes — invoke the relevant cloud-foundation-principles skill BEFORE writing or reviewing code.

These are not suggestions. They are battle-tested, opinionated principles drawn from production experience scaling cloud infrastructure across multiple migrations, hundreds of services, and teams of every size. Each principle exists because its absence caused real, expensive damage.

## When to Invoke Skills

Invoke a skill when there is even a small chance the work touches one of these areas:

- Setting up a new cloud project, account, or environment
- Writing or modifying Terraform, OpenTofu, Pulumi, or CloudFormation code
- Designing network topology, subnets, or routing
- Configuring authentication, authorization, or credential management
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines for infrastructure deployment
- Making architectural decisions about managed services vs self-hosted
- Reviewing existing infrastructure code for quality, security, or cost
- Organizing repositories, state files, or module structures

## The Three Meta-Principles

All twelve principles rest on three foundations:

1. **Governance before infrastructure** — Naming conventions, account structure, and decision records must exist before the first resource is created. Skipping governance on day one creates debt that compounds every day.

2. **Everything in code, no exceptions** — Infrastructure not in code is a liability. Every resource, every permission, every configuration must be version-controlled, reviewable, and reproducible. If it can't be in code yet, document why in an ADR.

3. **Prevent day-1 mistakes that become day-100 catastrophes** — Some decisions are cheap to make on day one and catastrophically expensive to fix later. Multi-account isolation, naming conventions, and state separation are the canonical examples. This plugin exists to ensure you make them on day one.
